In order to use rjags you have to have installed JAGS itself. This is relatively straightforward (I am told!) on your on PC, 
but can be non-trivial if you want to run it on HPCC. Here are some instructions one of our PhD students (Jingying Weng) got 
from ITS on how to do that...

Hi Jingying,

The installation of JAGS and rjags is a little involved for someone new to Linux but I'll include installation steps below. If you get stuck you can come to our office hours held weekly in Leavey Library 3M from 2:30-5pm. If you're unable to make it you can schedule a consultation either remote or in person at a more convenient time. You're also welcome to respond here if you have questions.

Best,

1. Install JAGS

Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Source/

Download JAGS-4.3.0.tar.gz to your project account:

wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/4.x/Source/JAGS-4.3.0.tar.gz

# unpack tarball

tar xvf JAGS-4.3.0.tar.gz
cd JAGS-4.3.0

# run configure script

./configure --with-blas=/usr/lib64/libopenblas.so --with-lapack=/usr/lib64/libopenblas.so --prefix=prefix_dir

# Set prefix_dir to path where you want JAGS installed. For example,
# /home/rcf-proj/spe1/wengjing/JAGS

# After configure completes run make to compile JAGS

make

# After make completes, run make install to install JAGS to prefix_dir

make install


2. Install rJAGS

To install R packages you must do a one time initialization step since R wants to save packages in ~/R

# Create R package directory
mkdir /home/rcf-proj/spe1/wengjing/R_packages

# Create "symbolic link" which points from ~/R to R_packages

cd ~
# This step fails if ~/R already exists
ln -s /home/rcf-proj/spe1/wengjinb/R_packages R

#Check to see if the link was created

ls -l

You should see R with an arrow pointing to /home/rcf-proj/spe1/wengjing/R_packages

# Set up your environment to install rJAGS

source /usr/usc/R/3.5.0/setup.sh


export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=prefix_dir
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=prefix_dir/lib

# Where prefix_dir is where you installed JAGS, ie /home/rcf-proj/spe1/wengjing/JAGS

# Start R and install rjags

R
install.packages("rjags")
